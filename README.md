# Meet - Dark
#### Under Development

A Simple Script to Make Meet - Minimal and more Low-light friendly.

Features:
 - Minimal Buttons
 - Dark Mode
 - Transparent Elements
 - Automatically apply theme upon Joining Meet
 
Issues:
 - Chat bar uses inversion filter which affects the Profile Pic
 - Requires 3rd party JS Injection Extension, like Tampermonkey or CustomJavaScript(CJS)
     - (workaround) Copy & paste the function code into the Page - Console
     - (another workaround) Save JS Script as a bookmark
